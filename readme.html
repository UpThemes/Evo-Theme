<h1>Getting Started with Evo</h1>
<p class="intro">Evo is a flexible, beautiful showcase-style WordPress theme with a very flexible layout, the ability to change thumbnail sizes, post videos, and more!</p>

<a href="#install">Skip to Installation Instructions</a>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Evo offers some robust but easy-to-use features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Three Beautiful Color Schemes</h3>
    <p>In addition to the default light theme, there are two additional color schemes as well, which can be enabled on the Evo Colors & Images Options page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>User Submission Page</h3>
    <p>By popular demand, Evo includes a submission page that can be customized to fit your needs inside the UpThemes Framework on the Submission Form options page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>AJAX Page Loading</h3>
    <p>Evo uses a custom twitter-style pagination to allow you to continue loading new posts into the page without being taken to a new page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>WordPress 3.0 Menu Support</h3>
    <p>Custom menus allow you to configure your navigation the way you want it! Evo features two menu zones in the header and footer, as well as unlimited widget menus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Simple Video Embedding</h3>
    <p>Easy video embedding using the Simple Video Embedder plugin from Press75.com makes video embedding easier than ever. Requires installation of Simple Video Embedder plugin, download separately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Resizable Thumbnails using WordPress 3's Featured Image</h3>
    <p>Thumbnail sizes are completely under your control! Just set your desired image sizes in 'Settings > Media' and setting the medium size image to the desired width and a height of 9999 (for images of various heights).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Ad Zones Built-in</h3>
    <p>There are now two ad zones that accept plain HTML and Javascript below the header and above the footer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="install"></a>Installing Evo</h2>

<ol>	
	<li>In WordPress' admin panel, go to 'Themes > Install Themes > Upload ' and browse to the Evo ZIP file.</li>
    <li>Click the 'Install Now' button.</li>	
	<li>Once installed, visit the UpThemes Framework theme options page and set up the various options you require.</li>
	<li>After that's done, go to <em>Settings</em> > <em>Reading</em> and set "Blog pages to show at most" to a number that makes your images end at the end of the last row of thumbails. For three across, I recommend 12 or 15, for 4 across, 12 or 16.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Additional Instructions</h2>

<h3>Adding Gallery Items</h3>
<p>To add gallery items, all you need to do is create a new post, upload an image of any size, select a category, and publish the post. <strong>DO NOT insert the image into the body of your post.</strong> This will result in an image on the right side of the page. If this is what you want, then ignore this warning. To create a lightbox image slider for the post, simply add multiple images to the post. Again, you do not need to post the image in the body of your post for Evo to do its thing.</p>

<h4>Using Widgets</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to Widgets.</li>
	<li>On the right side, there will be a set of widget zones for Index, Single, and Page. This allows you to add widgets to different sections of your site</li>
	<li>From the list of widgets, select a Text widget and drag it over to the zone you want the ads to be shown in.</li>
	<li>Enter the ad code into the textbox and save it.</li>
</ol>
